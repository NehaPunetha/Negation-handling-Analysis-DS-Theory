# Negation-handling-Analysis-DS-Theory
This project applies Dempster–Shafer theory to handle negation in sentiment analysis by modeling belief and plausibility. It fuses evidence from words and negation cues to capture uncertainty, enabling nuanced interpretation of phrases like “not good” or “not bad” for more accurate sentiment tagging.
